# Citadel Assessment Prep

Study material for preparing for Citadel's HackerRank coding assessment (75 minutes, 2-3 medium-hard problems).

## Study Guides — Python

| # | File | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | `01 algorithmic patterns.pdf` | Core coding patterns (arrays, trees, graphs, DP, greedy, binary search) with Python implementations |
| 2 | `02 python syntax reference.pdf` | Quick reference for Python data structures, operations, and common tricks |
| 3 | `03 time complexity cheat sheet.pdf` | Big O reference, acceptable complexities for Citadel constraints, and optimization techniques |
| 4 | `04 edge cases checklist.pdf` | Comprehensive checklist of edge cases by data structure — critical for Citadel's strict hidden test cases |
| 5 | `05 3day study plan.pdf` | Day-by-day study plan with recommended practice problems and a problem-solving approach for the assessment |

## Study Guides — C++
